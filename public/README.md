# Image Hosting

This is the **public** folder. You should upload your own images here to use them on your website.

## How to use:
1. Click "Add file" -> "Upload files" in this folder on GitHub.
2. Upload your image (e.g., `my-photo.jpg`).
3. In `content.ts`, use the URL `"/my-photo.jpg"`.

**Note:** Do not put `/public/` in the URL, just the slash `/` followed by the filename.
